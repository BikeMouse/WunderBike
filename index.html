								<h2>Chain and Cassette Swap</h2>
								<p>Chains and Cassettes do wear. It is the nature of moving parts. Your shifting not working properly? Most likely it is either of both parts that could cause the issue. Select "Chain and Cassette Swap" in the menu or <a href="chainAndCassette.html">follow the link</a> and have a look at the services we offer.</p>

								<h2>Brakes: Pads and Rotors Swap</h2>
								<p>Brakes are the most important parts of the bike. If they don't perform correctly, they are a hazard to your safety. Like cassettes and chains, brake pads (disc or rim) and rotors (disc) do wear over time. If you find yourself having issues with your brakes, select "Brakes" in the menu or <a href="brakePadsRotors.html">follow the link</a> to have a look at the services we offer.</p>
