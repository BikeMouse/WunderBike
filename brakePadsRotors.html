                                <h2>Brakes: Pads and Rotors Swap</h2>
                                <p>Brakes are the most important parts of the bike. If they don't perform correctly, they are a hazard to your safety. Like cassettes and chains, brake pads (disc or rim) and rotors (disc) do wear over time.</p>
                                <p>When looking around for Brake Rotors (for Discbrakes), you need to think about the mounting mechanism - centrelock or 6-hole.</p>

								<hr />

								<h3>Disc Brake Pads</h3>
								<p>Disc Brake Pads are the small parts that sandwich the Brake Rotor and stops the wheel. Due to riding conditions- muddy, rainy, etc- all sorts of grime and grease get sprayed at The Brake Rotors and Pads. Through that and normal wear and tear, Brake Pads do wear down - like the chain as example.</p>

								<p>So you may find that you don't have the braking power as you used to have and/or your braking makes awful noises. Changes are that your pads are contaminated and/or worn down and need replaced. We have the common range of pads stocked. Please get in touch with us by email! When you do, please tell us the Brand (Shimano or Sram) and Product Level (as Example "SLX") so we can provide you the appropriate Proposal.</p>

								<hr />

								<h3>Disc Brake Rotors</h3>
								<p>Disc Brake Rotors are the discs attached to your wheels. Experts do recommend that you do not touch them at all times, as the natural grease of our hands can contaminate them and our brake pads. For cleaning purposes rubbing alcohol is the substance of choice. Rotors do last considerably longer than the pads, but even they wear down eventually.</p>

								<p>Through storage, transporting, crashing and other things, Rotors can also become untrue. This can also be happening to a brand new one. To some degree it is fixable, but beyond that you will need a new one. Or when wear and tear and proceeded to a certain level. When contacting us about Rotors, please do indicate what Brand (Shimano or Sram) and Product Level (as example SLX) your Rotors are. Further more we would need to know the mounting style- 6-hole or centrelock.</p>
                                
                                <hr />

								<h3>Rim Brake Pads</h3>
								<p>Not every bike comes with Disc Brakes. Rim brakes are two blocks sandwiching your wheel's rims. Rim brakes have been the norm before the invention and rise in popularity of Disc Brakes.</p>

								<p>Rim brake pads also wear down over time and use. Contact us if you need new pads and please tell us the discipline you need - as example road. We will do our best to come back to you as fast as possible.</p>

								<hr />

								<h3>Disc Brake Bleeding</h3>
								<p>Disc Brakes occassionally need to be bled. That means there is air trapped in the system which needs to get out to impove braking performance.</p>

								<p>Diagnostics can be a little tricky with Disc Brakes, and it can happen you might think you need a new Rotor or Pad when in fact, you need to bleed your system. When that happens, we would provide you with a new Proposal for the service you required-  we keep it fair! We wont be forcing you into a service you don't need. We at Bike Hero also provide the quick bleeding service to get you back on the road, however we would encourage you in that instance you might want to look at local bike shops for the full bleed to be on the safe side.</p>

								<h3>Prices and Proposals</h3>

When reaching out to us, there are several things we would need to know in advance, so the appropriate items can be packed and delivered. Please provide the following information: Brand (Shimano or Sram), Product Level (SLX) and Discipline (Road or MTB).</p>
