						    	<p>Thanks for stopping by! In this section you will find services listed for Chain and Cassette Swaps. I encourage you to have a look around, and if there are questions, please send us a quick email, we will respond as soon as possible.</p>

								<h3>Chain Swap</h3>
								<p>Over time, chains do wear out and will affect our shifting. When the gears start skipping, it is usually down to a worn chain, cassette or both. The type of chain you will need depends on the amount of gears you have. To determine how many gears you got, count the sprockets on your rear wheel. The other detail to look out for is the Discipline: Road and Mountain Bikes have different needs in regards to the chain. So when ordering a chain, please tell us the Discipline that you need.</p>

								<h3>Cassette Swap</h3>
								<p>Over time, cassettes do wear out and will affect our shifting. When the gears start skipping, it is usually down to a worn chain, cassette or both. The type of cassette you will need depend on the amount of gears you have as well the brand you are using- Shimano or Sram. To determine how many gears you got, count the sprockets on your rear wheel. Like chains, Cassettes are different between Road and Mountainbikes. So please, if you contact us for this service please tell us the Discipline you need.</p>

                                <h3>Chain and Cassette Swap</h3>
								<p>Sometimes both parts of the drivetrain need to be replaced - chain and cassette. We at Bike Hero provide a "Bundle", meaning we will do both at the same time and save you time and money.</p>
